# Piwik SecurityInfo Plugin

## Description

We highly recommend that all Piwik administrators enable the SecurityInfo plugin, and then view the Settings. 

It is a tool in a multilayered security approach. It does not replace secure development practices nor audit the code\/application.

## Changelog

1.0 Initial release
