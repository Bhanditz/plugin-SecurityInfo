# Piwik SecurityInfo Plugin

## Description

We highly recommend that all Piwik administrators enable the SecurityInfo plugin, and then view the Settings. The plugin is a tool in a multilayered security approach.

## FAQ

__Does the plugin replace secure development practices or audit the code\/application?__

No, it doesn't. It just gives you some information based on PhpSecInfo from the PHP Security Consortium.

## Changelog

1.0 Initial release
